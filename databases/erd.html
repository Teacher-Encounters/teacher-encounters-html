        <h1>Entity Relationship Diagrams</h1>
        <p>
            This is a visual way to represent entities and relationships.
            However there are a number of different variations or notations.
            We will illustrate two of the most commonly found notations, namely
            Chen's and Crow's Feet notations.  Sometimes these may be referred
            respectively to as conceptial and logical ERD.
        </p>
        <h2>Chen's Notation</h2>
        <p>
            This representation is less focussed on the fact that databases are tables.
            Instead it focusses purely on the relationships and entities. It can also 
            include attributes but these may be omitted too.  They key shapes and lines 
            are illustrated below.  Sometimes you may see additional shapes however 
            these are rarely required and may be an evolution or variant of Chen's Notation.
        </p>

        <div class="eg">
            Now lets create an ERD using this notation.  
            To illustrate all possible shapes I used an associative entity for "Attendees".
            In our original sketch of the data we would have it as a multivalued attribute like "History".
            Being an associative entity means that "Attendees" is both an entity and a relationship.
            It defines the Many to Many relationship between EVENTS and PEOPLE but is also an 
            entity in and of itself. <br/><br/>

        </div>
        <h2>Crow's Foot Notation</h2>
        <p>
            This representation is often more closely linked to actual databases.
            If your DBMS generated any ERD they will often use this or a similar format.
            Indeed Enhanced ERDs nearly always use this format and differ only in that 
            all attributes are specified alongside both their data types and any constraints.
            However for normal Crow's Foot Notation ERD you only need the illustrated below shapes and lines.
        </p>

        <div class="eg">
            Now lets convert the previous ERD into this notation.<br/><br/>
            <img src="../assets/databases/crow_foot_eg.jpg" alt="Example Chen's Notation"><br/><br/>
            If you used a DBMS to generate an ERD you may end up with an enhanced ERD (EERD) like below.<br/><br/>

        <div class="info">
            Optional or not Optional?  In this case I've opted to not use Optional relationships.
            This is because I have assumed:
            <ul>
                <li>You can't store attendees unless there is an associated event and person.</li>
                <li>This means you don't store all attendees - you only store one's you know about (i.e. in PEOPLE table)</li>
                <li>Similarly you don't store people who do not appear in your FRIENDS.</li>
                <li>And also you don't store any freind unless they're already a known person.</li>
            </ul>
            You may decide that you want to store all attendees at an event.
            This would mean you would have an optional relationship between PEOPLE and FRIENDS.
            As you need to store strangers in your PEOPLE table for all attendees to be recorded.
            Yet many of these PEOPLE are not in your FRIENDS table either as a friend or as someone unfriended.
