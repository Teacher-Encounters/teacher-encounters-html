        <h1>SQLite</h1>
        <p>
            Now it's time to look at using a database in anger.
            There are a number of different SQL variants each usually associated to a specific engine.
            This engine runs the SQL (both DDL and DML) to ensure your database is up and running.
            For this we will use SQLite ..
        </p>
        <p>
            To make life easier we will also make use of a DBMS.
            Where SQLite can run our raw queries, the DBMS provides a easier to use interface.
            We can use this to perform basic operations usually called CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
            For this we will use ...
        </p>
        <p>
            For you to run a database you need an engine up and running.
            You can do without the DBMS.
            However the DBMS provides a handy way to monitor the current state of the database.
            This means people can fully manage a database using just the DBMS.
            Obviously we won't be doing this as we LOVE SQL!
