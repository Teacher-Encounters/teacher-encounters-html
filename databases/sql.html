        <h1>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h1>
        <p>
            Please note SQL can be pronounced S-Q-L.
            However it is also common to pronounce it as SeQueL.
            This maybe due to it being easier to pronounce or the fact SQL
            first started life as Structured English QUEry Language (SEQUEL).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
            But be mindful that each DBMS will likely use it's own version of SQL like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
            They must provide implement the following standard set of commands.
            But they may provide additional commands or functionality that you may wish to use.
            Likewise data types can vary between languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            When answering questions on SQL it is best to focus on the standard outlined here.
            It can be tempting to add in a useful extra command that you know is in <em>most</em> languages.
            I'd avoid this but feel free in your coding to use these extras if they help.
        </p>
        <div>
            The critical aspect of SQL is that it is actually two distinct languages:
            <dl>
                <dt>Data Definition Language (DDL)</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is used to define our database, as well as make any changes to it's schema.
                    For example you may have a Customers table and decide you want to add "Twitter ID" as a column.
                    Whereas when you first created the table, you did not see a need for their Twitter IDs.
                </dd>
    
                <dt>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</dt>
                <dd>
                    As you may have guessed DML is all of SQL that has nothing to do with modifying schema.  
                    Instead we use it to perform operations or manipulate the data in our tables.
                    This is where we run queries to answer a question like "how many customers live in the UK?", or 
                    "what is the address I am sending this parcel for John Smith?".
                    Or we may insert a new customer or update their contact details
                </dd>
            </dl>
            It is worth pointing out that it is a common standard for all DDL and DML to be written in uppercase.
            This is not required however it does make it easier to distinguish the instructions from your settings.
            Therefore it is often easier to spot any mistakes like if you've created a table missing an attribute.
            I'd advise you follow this convention including any non-standard SQL commands.
            For example many variants include a function to convert text to upper case, often called upper.
            If we used this in our queries we would write UPPER() not upper().
        </div>
        <h2>Data Definition Language (DDL)</h2>
        <div>
            The key element of this language are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>CREATE DATABASE dbName;</code> This creates a database called 'dbName'. <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>DROP DATABASE dbName;</code> This deletes the database 'dbName'.<br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <pre>
                        CREATE TABLE tableName (
                            &nbsp&nbsp columnName dataType constraints,
                            &nbsp&nbsp ID int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                            &nbsp&nbsp Name varchar(255) DEFAULT 'John Smith'
                        );
                    </pre>
                    This creates a table called tableName with two attributes - ID (int) and Name (varchar).
                    You must set the columnName and dataType but your attributes may have no constraints.
                    For simplicity we will use the data types outlined in <a href="./norm.html">Terminology (Field aka Attribute aka 'Column')</a>.
                    Or alternatively they may use one or more of the following constraints:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>NOT NULL</code> to prevent NULL values</li>
                        <li><code>UNIQUE</code> to prevent duplicate values from being stored</li>
                        <li><code>PRIMARY KEY</code> to identify primary key. Implicity enforces <code>NOT NULL</code> and <code>UNIQUE</code>, as well as creating an index.</li>
                        <li><code>FOREIGN KEY</code> to identify foreign key</li>
                        <li><code>DEFAULT</code> to set a default value if one is not provided on INSERT</li>
                        <li><code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> is similar to DEFAULT but the default value is a unique number for each record starting at 1 and increasing by 1</li>
                        <li><code>CHECK</code> to set a custom validation so it rejects any invalid data on INSERT or UPDATE</li>
                    </ul><br/>
                    It is worth checking each variant to validate how these are used.
                    But for 'standard' SQL you can put them in "constraints".  
                    You do not need to join these with an AND or similar instead just list them like <code>NOT NULL UNIQUE DEFAULT 'abc'</code>.
                    Please be aware that <code>FOREIGN KEY</code> must specify the table it links to and it's primary key like so 
                    <code>FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES tableName2(primaryKey)</code>.
                    For <code>CHECK</code> you also need to specify the actual constraint e.g. <code>Age int CHECK (Age>=0)</code>.
                    If you need a composite <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> then you add the following at the end of the definition 
                    <code>CONSTRAINT PK_Name PRIMARY KEY (attribute1,attribute2)</code>.
                    This means the primary key is a composite of "attribute1" and "attribute2".
                    The "PK_Name" can be any unique name for primary key index - usually you prefix it with PK to indicate Primary Key.<br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>DROP TABLE tableName;</code> This deletes table 'tableName'.<br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>TRUNCATE TABLE tableName;</code>  This deletes all the data in table 'tableName' but the actual table still exists. <br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <pre>
                        CREATE INDEX indx_name
                        ON tableName (ColumnName);
                    </pre>
                    You can create an index over multiple columns but replacing "ColumnName" with comma separated list e.g. "FirstName, LastName".
                    Please note INDEXes are not visible to you.  These are used to improve performance on your queries.
                    You may think, "If they're that awesome then why no index EVERYTHING?".  DO NOT DO THIS!
                    Indexes have a cost, not just in storage but in performance when inserting or updating data.
                    Any affected index needs to be updated to include the new or changed value.
                    So adding them to all your columns would be very bad for your performance.
                    Instead we add them to any column(s) that are expected to be used for search.
                    A common example is a Name.  Usually this is not a Primary Key as names may change.
                    However we humans tend to remember names over IDs so making a Name quicker to lookup would be a good idea.<br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can also alter a table in a few different ways:
                    <pre>
                        ALTER TABLE tableName
                        ADD Email varchar(255);
                    </pre>
                    <pre>
                        ALTER TABLE tableName
                        DROP COLUMN Name;
                    </pre>
                    <pre>
                        ALTER TABLE tableName
                        RENAME COLUMN ID to TwitterHandle;
                    </pre>
                    Please note that some SQL variants also provide a way to modify a column's type and constraints e.g. changing ID to varchar.
                    For changing a column's type you can also change or add constraints.  
                    The same is true for ADDing columns - you may also include constraints.
                    Please see <code>CREATE TABLE</code> for more information on constraints.<br/>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h2>
            <div>
                The key element of this language is the <code>SELECT</code> statement.
                It follows the form:
                <pre>
                    SELECT t.columnName1, t.columnName2 AS c, tt.aColumnName AS a
                    FROM tableName AS t
                    INNER JOIN tableName2 AS tt ON t.foreignKey = tt.primaryKey
                    WHERE c = 'abc'
                    &nbsp&nbsp OR c = 'def'
                    GROUP BY a
                    ORDER BY columnName1, c DESC;
                </pre>
                Please note that this form does not cover 100% of use cases.
                It does however cover all the key SQL commands on your A Level syllabus. 
                Time to break the statement down (and the order is important too):
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We always have a <code>SELECT</code> line.
                        You can choose to select all columns by using <code>SELECT *</code> rather than listing all columns.
                        If you have an <code>JOIN</code> you must prefix all columns with the associated tableName.
                        This ensures we get the correct data.  
                        If you don't have a join then you can omit the table name as a prefix, e.g. <code>columnName1</code>.
                        You can also uses <code>AS</code> to create an alias for a column name.
                        This is handy when using that later in the query.
                        It can also be used to rename the results column.
                        You can also apply aggregate functions, like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code>SUM</code> to get the total sum of this attribute providing it is numeric.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>COUNT</code> to get the number of rows that match this query.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>AVG</code> to get the average of this attribute providing it is numeric.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>MIN</code> to get the smallest value of this attribute.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>MAX</code> to get the largest value of this attribute.
                            </li>
                        </ul><br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We always have a <code>FROM</code> line to identify the table we are querying.
                        Like the attributes this may also use <code>AS</code> to define an alias.<br/><br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We then have any <code>JOIN</code> statements.
                        This is not needed if you only need to use one table for your query.
                        We then tell the query the table to join to and then <code>ON</code> the attributes.
                        In a normalised database, usually this join is between a specific foreign key and the other table's primary key.
                        It is worth noting that you can join with more than two tables.
                        Additional this is the standard join which we call <code>INNER JOIN</code>.
                        This does mean there are other types of joins but these are not covered; 
                        <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code>, <code>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code>,<code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code><br/><br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The next part is <code>WHERE</code> which is used to limit or filter the results.
                        This is not required unless you want to limit or filter your results.
                        You may use multiple conditions joining with <code>AND</code>, and <code>OR</code>.
                        If you use both <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> then use brackets <code>(  )</code> to ensure the correct interpretation.
                        Additionally you can negate a condition by prefixing it with <code>NOT</code>, for example <code>NOT IN ('A', 'B', 'C')</code>.
                        As for conditions you can apply to the attributes, you can use the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Comparison operators <code>=, &gt, &lt, &lt=, &gt=, , &lt&gt</code>.
                                Note that the last operator is used for not equals (rather than !=).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>LIKE</code> to match using wildcards.
                                For example <code>LIKE 'a%'</code> would match all values starting with an 'a'.
                                For example <code>LIKE '_M'</code> would match all values that are two letters long and end in a 'M'.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>IN</code> to match a set of values.
                                This is a shorter way to check equality against a set of values.
                                For example <code>columnName IN ('A', 'B', 'C')</code> is that same check as 
                                <code>columnName = 'A' OR columnName = 'B' OR columnName = 'C'</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>BETWEEN</code> to match a given range.
                                Therefore <code>columnName BETWEEN 10 AND 15</code> is a shortened version of
                                <code>columnName &gt= 10 AND columnName &lt= 15</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>IS NULL</code> to match an attribute that has not been set and so is <code>NULL</code>.
                            </li>
                        </ul><br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we have <code>GROUP BY</code> which can take a single column or mulitple columns.
                        This is only needed if we want to collate our results into groups.
                        This is therefore often used alongside aggregate functions, 
                        for example to <code>COUNT(*)</code> the number of matches in the group.<br/><br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And finally we have <code>ORDER BY</code> which can take a single column or multiple columns.
                        This orders the results by the column(s).
                        When multiple columns are specified we order rows by the first column and any rows with the 
                        same value in this column are then ordered by the next column and so on.
                        As a result if you ordered by a column with a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint like a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>.
                        Then putting an additional column after this would be pointless as the column will have no duplicate values for the next column to sort.
                        The example below as <code>DESC</code> to indicate descending order.
                        For ascending order you can omit this as it defaults to ascending or put <code>ASC</code> instead.<br/>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                The remaining elements of DML are the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <pre>
                            INSERT INTO tableName (attribute1, attribute2, attribute3)
                            VALUES (1, 2, 3),
                            VALUES (4, 5, 6);
                        </pre>
                        This inserts the specified values at the given attributes for the table identified.
                        The above example inserts two rows but it can insert many more or just insert one row.
                        If you are inserting all attributes you can omit the list and so line 1 becomes <code>INSERT INTO tableName</code>.
                        If you only insert a subset of values ensure the remaining attributes have a <code>DEFAULT</code> or maybe <code>NULL</code>.
                        This is because any other attribute will be set to <code>NULL</code> if no default value or the provided default value.
                        Therefore is <code>attribute4</code> exists and must be <code>NOT NULL</code> then the <code>INSERT</code> will fail.
                        Likewise it will fail if any constraint is not met.
                        This notably includes ensuring Referential Integrity - i.e. all foreign keys link to a valid record.

                    <li>
                        <pre>
                            UPDATE tableName
                            SET attribute1 = 'a', attribute2 = 'b', attribute3 = 'c'
                            WHERE primaryKey = 1;
                        </pre>
                        This updates a specific table by setting the given attributes to the values provided.
                        You may update one or more attributes and do not need to update all attributes in the table.
                        Like the <code>SELECT</code> command we have a <command>WHERE</command> subclause.
                        It behaves exactly the same way however now it is updating one or more records.
                        Update may fail if your update fails any existing constraint on your table similar to when <code>INSERT</code> fails.
                        <p class="danger">
                            Yes you can run an update without a <code>WHERE</code> being provided.
                            However this means you will update all records.
                            Odds are you don't want that.

                            WHERE primaryKey = 1;
                        </pre>
                        Like <code>SELECT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> we have a where clause.
                        In this case the matching records are deleted from our table.
                        Please note that <code>DELETE tableName</code> is a valid command.
                        This would be the same as DDL's <code>TRUNCATE TABLE tableName;</code> and would drop all data in the table.
                        Please be aware <code>DELETE</code> can also fail.
                        If you tried to delete a customer that had an associated order then it would fail.
                        Otherwise you would have an order that relates no customer.
                        Delete the orders first then the customer.

                    Be aware your database may not fail <code>DELETE</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> when it comes to referential integrity.
                    In the previous example we had a customer being deleted before their orders.
                    Some variants and DBMS may provide additional options, often referred to as:

                            So that on deletion of a customer, all associated records like orders, cards, etc are also removed. 
                            Similarly if we update a customer ID it will ensure all foreign keys using the old customer ID are updated also.

                            When you delete a customer or change their ID then all associated records like orders, cards, etc are set to <code>NULL</code>.
                            If the attribute cannot be set to <code>NULL</code> then an error will be raised.

                            When you delete a customer or change their ID then all associated records like orders, cards, etc are set to the <code>DEFAULT</code>.
                            If the attribute does not have a <code>DEFAULT</code> set then an error will be raised.

                It is important to ensure you create your tables in the correct order.
                For example we cannot create Attendees table unless both People and Events tables exist.
                We also assume the database we created is the only one present and so will be the default database used.
                If this was not the case then our tables would need to be prefixed with our database e.g. <code>FaceBase.Events</code>.<br/><br/>

                Here are a few example queries using DML.
                Please note I've omitted the many, many <code>INSERT</code>s for brevity.
                I will include the full SQL for FaceBase when we look at creating it.
                This is because I will choose to use a specific database and may need to modify the SQL to fit the variant.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This will get all people in FaceBase, current or former friend, that have a gender of Male (CM).
                        <pre>
                            SELECT *

                            WHERE Gender = 'CM'

                    <li>
                        This will get, for each county, the number of people in the county and the name of the county.
                        The results will be in descending order of number of people in the county.
                        <pre>
                            SELECT a.name As TheCounty, COUNT(p.Id) As NumPeople

                        This will get your current friend list.
                        Sadly it is very complex and relies upon sub-queries. 
                        These sub-queries are used where we once had tableNames specified.
                        Unfortunately this could translate to slower overvall performance too.
                        To break this down it:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Runs <code>j1</code> resulting in a table with the attributes Id, Person and LastUpdate.
                                This groups all the updates by the associated person and gets the last time it was updated.
                                But now we are missing information, namely was the last update to add friend or unfriend?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                So we run <code>j2</code> that gets the full information on the last updates per person.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finally we can then run the query that filters out the people last unfreinded and returns 
                                us all the key information about that person.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <pre>
                            SELECT p.*, j2.UpdatedAt, j2.ReasonForUpdate
                            FROM People as p
                            INNER JOIN (

                                &nbsp&nbsp WHERE u.IsFriend = true
                            ) AS j2 ON j2.Person = p.Id

                                You are probably wondering where we went wrong.
                                It can't be that complex to get our friend list?  Something is not right!
                                This illustrates one good point about databases, sometimes our 3NF database 
                                can still feel 'wrong' or inefficient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It would be tempting to revisit our previous decisions.
                                When we removed "Is Friend Now?" and "Last updated Is Friend Now?" from 
                                the People table.  It was because we had a Friends table and these attributes 
                                are Friends not People attributes.  However we found the Friends table redundant.
                                We could have kept the Friends table and so the query would be:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                                SELECT p.*, f.LastUpdatedIfn As LastAdded
                                FROM Friends AS f
                                INNER JOIN People ON p.Id = f.Person
                                WHERE f.IsFriendNow = true
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                However this means create a new table and storing duplicate data.
                                There is a risk the data is not kept updated. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alternatively we add a link from People to their latest update.
                                Our PEOPLE Table would then have <code>LastUpdate int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Updates(Id)</code>.
                                When we first create a record for a person <code>LastUpdate</code> would be <code>NULL</code> and 
                                likewise when we delete the person we would need to return it to <code>NULL</code>.
                                Otherwise we could not delete a person due to the updates and deleting the updates would delete 
                                all but the last update as the person links to it!
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                                SELECT p.*, j2.UpdatedAt, j2.ReasonForUpdate
                                FROM (People as p
                                INNER JOIN Updates AS u ON u.Id = p.LastUpdate)
                                WHERE u.IsFriend = true
                            </pre>

                                This avoids extra data but then requires a circular link between a person and their last update.
                                So you need to be careful when deleting data.

                                Or finally we may concede - "Do we actually care about our friend history?".
                                When looking at entities and how you translate them into database designs you 
                                may miss interesting attributes and may includes ones that you don't need or want.
                                Instead it may be better to remove Updates table.
                                Then we add <code>lastFriended date</code> and <code>lastUnfriended date</code> to the People table.
                                This means we can work out if someone is a friend and how long that last change to friend status was.

                Be careful of SQL INJECTION.
                Like any form of injection attack it starts by taking user input and not checking it's safe.
                Therefore we could have the following code:
                <pre>
                    query = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = "
                    inp = input("What was your ID?")
                    print(SQL.execute(query + inp))
                </pre>
                If a malicious actor comes along they could use the input like:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <pre>1 OR 1=1</pre>
                        This means they would see all customers as 1=1 is ALWAYS TRUE making the WHERE condition useless.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <pre>1; DROP TABLE Customers</pre>
                        The semi-colon means your query is now actually two SQL commands.
                        One fetches the data for Customer 1 and the other deletes your entire Customer table.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Each programming language does include protection from these issues.
                As long as you remember NOT to use raw SQL.  For example (in pseudocode):
                <pre>
                    query = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = ?"
                    inp = input("What was your ID?")
                    cmd = new SqlCommand(query)
                    cmd.add_parameter("?", inp)
                    print(cmd.execute())
                </pre>
                These methods ensure the input is correctly escaped to prevent SQL Injection.
