        <h1>What are Databases?</h1>
        <p>
            It is a structured way of storing data specifically containing a number of tables.
            Read the below key concepts to understand more.
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary>Entity</summary>
            An object about which data is to be captured.
            <p class="eg">
                For FaceBase we have the entities; Event, Attendees, Person, and Friend Status.
                Note that entities and tables are related as we store entities in the tables.
                The easiest way to differentiate them is that entities will have a lot of additional information.
                This information is not stored in our table, e.g. a person has their own favourite band, film and colour.
                We don't store this information as we don't need it for FaceBase.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Table</summary>
            An collection of related data in tabular form.
            <p class="eg">
                For FaceBase we currently have the tables; Event, Person, and Friend.
                Note that entities and tables are related as we store entities in the tables.
                The easiest way to differentiate them is that entities will have a lot of additional information.
                This information is not stored in our table, e.g. a person has their own favourite band, film and colour.
                We don't store this information as we don't need it for FaceBase.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Field aka Attribute aka 'Column'</summary>
            An set of data values in a table.
            <div class="eg">
                In the PEOPLE table we have; ID, Name, Gender, DoB, Is Friend Now?, and Last Updated "Is Friend Now?"
                Because we are storing data in a table each field can only have a certain set of values.
                In most relational tables, these following are different types of data:
                <dl>
                    <dt>CHARACTER or CHAR</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Fixed length strings i.e. text.  We could use it for Gender if we reduce them to one character "M" and "F", or two "CM" and "CF".
                    </dd>

                    <dt>VARCHAR(n)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Variable length strings i.e. text.  We may specify a maximum length or not.
                        We would use this for names as they may be as short as "Ed" or as long as "Laurence ... Watkins".
                        VARCHAR(10) is similar to CHARACTER(10) in that it is a text value with maximum length of 10.
                        However CHARACTER is more efficient to VARCHAR as the values should be the same length.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>BOOLEAN</dt>
                    <dd>A True or False value like "Is Friend Now?"</dd>

                    <dt>INTEGER or INT</dt>
                    <dd>A whole number like "Age" if we stored this.</dd>

                    <dt>REAL</dt>
                    <dd>A fractional (i.e. not whole number) like "height" if we stored this.</dd>

                    <dt>DATE</dt>
                    <dd>A date for example "DoB" (Date of Birth).</dd>

                    <dt>TIME</dt>
                    <dd>A time like "online" (i.e. time when a person is ONLINE) if we stored this.</dd>
                </dl>
                Each database may provide additional data types like LONGTEXT (for text with very large length), 
                BIGINT (for INT with a very large/low value), or DATETIME (to store both date and time).  Likewise 
                some datatypes may be aliased or defined differently e.g. REAL is sometimes FLOAT or DOUBLE
                (DOUBLE is larger so can be more precise), or DECIMAL (if storing something fixed like money).
                By default all fields may be NULL, so we do not have any Optional(...) datatypes.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Record aka Tuple aka 'Row'</summary>
            An set of data stored in a table.
            <p class="eg">
                For the PEOPLE table a row would represent a person like; 
                001 (ID), John Doe (Name), Gender (M), 01/01/2000 (DoB), True (Is Friend Now?), 01/01/2024 (Last Updated "Is Friend Now?")
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Candidate Key</summary>
            A unique identifier for a record within a table.
            May consist of a single field or a combination.
            <div class="eg">
                For the PEOPLE table we can have the following candidate keys.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Personal ID</em></li>
                    <li><em>Name</em></li>
                    <li><em>Last Updated "Is Friend Now?"</em> AND <em>Is Friend Now?</em> AND <em>DoB</em></li>
                </ul>
                Candidate keys may use multiple fields to uniquely identify a record.
                For this example I am assuming "Name" refers to what you call your friend.
                So if you had two friends both "John Smith", I'm assuming you store them with different names.
                Such as "John 'Jo' Smith" and "John 'Big' Smith".  Otherwise "Name" alone would not be enough.
                Indeed this should remind you about the concept of "identifiable" in GDPR as our table relates to PEOPLE.
                For example if we stored their mobile number then this could be a candidate key, or
                if we stored their address then this alongside their DoB could be a candidate key.
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Primary Key</summary>
            The unique identifier for a record within a table.
            This a Candidate Key, usually the one using the least number of fields.
            <p class="eg">
                For our PEOPLE table we've chosen "Personal ID". 
                Often we will choose the primary key by using an automatically generated ID (e.g. 1 is for the first record).
                But you can opt for something more meaningful "Big", "Jo" and "John" i.e. the unique name you use to refer to them.
                This is not a great example of a primary key as it seems logical that you may change how you refer to people.
                Therefore for following examples I will assume "Personal ID" is a generated unique ID.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Secondary Key</summary>
            Candidate keys that are not Primary Keys.
            <p class="eg">
                In our PEOPLE table we would definitely set "Name" as a secondary key.
                Identifying secondary keys are useful as we can request the database index them for better performance.
                It makes sense you may look for a person in your PEOPLE database using their name.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Foreign Key</summary>
            A link from the current table to another.
            This maps on to a candidate key from the other table, usually the primary key.
            <p class="eg">
                Currently our example database does not have any foreign keys in our PEOPLE table.
                However we can see the FRIENDS table includes "Name" and we know this should be the same as the "Name" in the PEOPLE table.
                Therefore "Name" in the PEOPLE table is a secondary key but in the FRIENDS is a foreign key.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Referential Integrity</summary>
            This means that the data is accurate and consistent between tables and
            so all references are valid.  As a result every foreign key must relate 
            to an existing record in another table.
            <p class="eg">
                We have a link from FRIENDS table using "Name" on to the PEOPLE table.
                We should NOT have any record with a "Name" that does not correspond to a record in the PEOPLE table.
                So if a record in the PEOPLE table has "Name" changed, we must update the "Name" where it appears in the FRIENDS table.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Relationship</summary>
            This is a connection between one table (Table A) and another (Table B).  
            We have the following types of relationships:            
            <dd>
                <dl>
                    <dt>One To One (1:1)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Each record in Table A relates to one (and only one) record in Table B.
                        Likewise each record in Table B may relate to one (and only one) record in Table A.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>One To Many (1:N)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Each record in Table A may relate to zero, one or many records in Table B.
                        Yet Table B can only relate to one record in Table A.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Many To Many (N:N)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Like One To Many, each record in Table A may relate to zero, one or many records in Table B.
                        Unlike One To Many, each record in Table B may relate to zero, one or many records in Table A.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </dd>
            <p class="eg">
                We have a relationship from FRIENDS table using "Name" on to the PEOPLE table.
                At the moment it is not unambiguous as to the type of relationship this is.
                It could be a One To Many, as each record in FRIENDS can only relate to one record in PEOPLE.
                Whilst one record in PEOPLE may relate to many entries in FRIEND.
                More likely we mean this relationship to be One To One so that each Friend relates to a record in PEOPLE and vice versa.
                In contrast we have a Many To Many relationship between "Name" from PEOPLE and "Name" within "Details of Attendees" in EVENTS.
                Therefore you may have a record in PEOPLE who have attended many or no EVENTS.
                Whilst you may have EVENTS with no or many PEOPLE as attendees.

            <summary>Schema</summary>
            The way the data is organised into tables for our database.
            <p class="eg">
                Our draft of our database is a very high level schema.
                This schema will be improved as we consider indexing and normalisation.
                Schemas usually also include low level details such as data types and constraints.

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Indexing</summary>
            This is the way to get the unordered tables into an order that will maximise 
            the efficiency of our queries when searching for data.  Your chosen 
            Database Management Software (DBMS) handles indexing based on your schema.
            <p class="eg">
                All our primary keys will be indexed.
                Our PEOPLE table we can also index the secondary key "Name".
                This will allow us to search more efficiently for PEOPLE by their name.

        <details>
            <summary>Normalisation</summary>
            A process of organising data in the database.
            This is used to reduce duplication and improve data integrity.

            <summary>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</summary>
            This is a visual way to represent entities and relationships.
            They show the critical aspects of a database to ensure the data
            desired is stored and can be effectively queried.  Some DBMS may
            autogenerate an ERD of an existing database.  You can create an ERD
            prior to creating a database.
