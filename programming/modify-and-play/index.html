            <h1>Modify and Play</h1>
            <p>For this exercise you will be modifying and playing with an existing project.</p>
            <p>The code you are given to experiment with makes use of all of the concepts covered so far, and more.</p>

            <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/RatraceJoe/sketches/lz5njCzsF">Existing Code</a>

            <p>Drag your mouse across the grey square, this will sprinkle gold ‘food pellets’. The Boids will be attracted to the nearest food, when they find it, they eat it. Boids gradually lose health which they replenish when they eat food.</p>
            <p>Try to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify the colours, sizes, names of the Boids and the food pellets.</li>
                <li>Play around with the other values and see what eUect they have on the</li>
                simulation.
                <li>Randomly add new food items every frame
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find the draw function and add lines 34-37 from below</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
